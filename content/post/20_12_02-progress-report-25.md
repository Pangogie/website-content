## New Content!

### Botany

### Alerts System and UI
*Contibuted by chairbender*

What was previously known as "status effects" has been expanded into a more general "alerts" system, which allows contributors to easily define and modify the alert icons and tooltips. They also use significantly less bandwidth.

As shown below, the corresponding UI was improved to closely match our UI mockups. Alert tooltips now have formatted text and color, and the alerts live in an improved grid container which can dynamically expand as more alerts appear.

### Power cells
*Contributed by brndd*

Ports Eris-style power cells. They come in three distinct sizes, S, M and L, each size having more charge than the last and fitting into different kinds of devices.
